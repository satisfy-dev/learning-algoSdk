This is just a repo for me to practice and learn building transactions with AlgoSDK and direclty using myAlgo Connect, instead of using Reach abstraction. The front end is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

**Developed by**: [Sunday Akinbowale](https://github.com/asolpshinning)

## Activity Log

**08/24/2022** - `pages/test1` is the main page I am currently performing my tests, while learning. Most transactions are working well, except myAlgo is not able to sign logic signatures


## Next Plan (Possibly)

- Try to sign logic signatures with sk
- Get a logic signature in a group transaction and see how everything works together
- See what other wallet can be used to sign lsig
- Try the myAlgo way of signing arbitrary data, and see if this would be useful for signing in functionality
- build a wallet that does everything you want it to do (start by forking myAlgo Connect and rewrite it)


## To Run This Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd src
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
